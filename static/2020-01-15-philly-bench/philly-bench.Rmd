The Philadelphia 76ers made headlines last week when they announced that injuries and COVID-19 restrictions would limit their active roster to only eight players for their game against the Denver Nuggets. Only seven players ended up getting minutes (Mike Scott was just returning from injury) and the team lost 103-115. The Nuggets, in comparison, had 15 players on their active roster, all of whom checked into the game. 

This, along with the games being postponed across the league due to insufficient rosters (NBA rules require at least eight players dress), got me curious, how does the length of a team's rotation affect their chances of winning? Does the lack of depth hurt teams late in the game or is it a trait of good teams that donâ€™t need to rely on as many players to win games?

```{r short_bench_table, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
play_pg = setDT(read.csv("players_pg.csv"))
short_data = play_pg[players < 8, .(count = .N, home = sum(home), win = sum(win), opp_play = mean(opp_players), pts = mean(pts), opp_pts = mean(opp_pts)), by = type]
short_data_tot = play_pg[players < 8, .(count = .N, home = sum(home), win = sum(win), opp_play = mean(opp_players), pts = mean(pts), opp_pts = mean(opp_pts))]
short_table = data.frame(rbind(short_data[,type := NULL], short_data_tot))
rownames(short_table) = c("Regular Season","Playoffs","Total")
colnames(short_table) = c("Games","Home","Win","Avg. Opp. Players", "Avg. Points", "Avg. Opp. Points")
kable_paper(kable(short_table,
  digits = 2),"hover",full_width=F)
```

The lack of data shows just how unique of a position the 76ers were in but looking at the larger rotations from the past five regular seasons, a pattern begins to emerge. On the surface, it does look like teams that have a shorter bench win more games. 

```{r win_pct_bar, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
win_data = play_pg[type == "Regular" & players > 7, .(win_pct = 100*mean(win)), by = players]
boxplot(win_data[order(players),win_pct], names.arg = c(8,9,10,11,12,13,14), xlab = "Number of Players", ylab = "Win %", col = "darkblue", ylim = c(0,60))
```

Looking a bit deeper however, we can see that the Houston Rockets account for almost half of the eight player wins and more than their fair share of nine player wins as well.
